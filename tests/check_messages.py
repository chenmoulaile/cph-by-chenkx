"""Cross-check the release notes against messages.json, in both directions.

    python tests/check_messages.py

It lives beside run_tests.py and check_py33.py on purpose: those are the two
scripts CI runs, and .workbuddy/ is `export-ignore`d in .gitattributes and
skipped by publish_api.py, so a step pointing into it would fail with
"no such file or directory" on every runner.

Why this exists
---------------
tests/run_tests.py only checks the one direction "every file named in
messages.json exists". That passes forever even when a published version has
no upgrade message at all, which is exactly how v2.1.1 and v1.4.7 shipped:
both have a tag, a GitHub release and a section in RELEASE_NOTES_CN.md, and
neither has a messages/ file or a messages.json key.

The other tempting check - "messages/ minus the files messages.json names" -
is useless here: messages.json and messages/ agree with each other on both
missing versions, so the difference is empty and the script is green forever.
The only source that knows about a version independently is the release
notes, so that is what the comparison is anchored on:

    RELEASE_NOTES_CN.md  "# vX.Y.Z" headings   vs   messages.json keys

Everything older than MIN_VERSION predates the message file mechanism (and the
notes themselves jump from 1.4.0 back to 1.2.2), so those are whitelisted.

Exit code 0 when both sides agree, 1 when a version is missing on either side
or a key/file mapping is broken.
